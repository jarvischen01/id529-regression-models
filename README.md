You can:
- Download a .zip file of this repository and run and annotate the code in id529_day4_regression_models.R 
- Clone the repository and do the same.
- Just follow along in the lecture.

The accompanying id529_modelingWorkflows.pdf contains a few opening slides.

The folder also contains output that we will produce along the way.
